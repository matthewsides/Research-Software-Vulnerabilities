Abstract.
              
Through analysis and deduction, this report contains information based around the topic of software development and vulnerabilities as a whole, further delving into the idea of vulnerabilities in software development through case study examples. Subsequently further down the document the mitigation of said vulnerabilities is covered, explaining a few methods of preventing or fixing said breaches that may occur, coming to a conclusion as to whether the case studies overlooked could have been mitigated and prevented before the situation spiralled out of hand.

#### [1] Introduction 

This documentation pertains to the reduction of software vulnerabilities during development, further delving into the subject or topics of what software development (this includes Software-Development-Life-Cycles | SDLC) and vulnerabilities are, defining and suggesting possible solutions to said vulnerabilities during development, using case studies as illustrations and to portray the risks that herald with not mitigating vulnerabilities properly. 
Thereafter concluding the various ways in which to resolve (fix) and reduce vulnerabilities encountered during the development or finished production of a system, covering a self-opinionated view and lightly addressing the issues usually encountered, re-defining software development and vulnerabilities to better bring the final point across (use as a reminder).

#### [2] Software Development  
Software development is a meticulous and complex process to develop software, comprised of numerous stages. In addition to the development and planning process, each stage generally entails documentation, in contrast to what is commonly known or how software development is usually portrayed (in media) Jimenez et al. No date). 
A software development project must at least entail the following stages (though not constrained to the below list), a view supported by Abrahamsson et al. (2002):

I.	Client Brief

II.	Requirement gathering 

III.	Writing functional specifications 

IV.	Creating architecture and design documents 

V.	Implementation and coding

VI.	Testing and quality assurance 

VII. Software release 

VIII.	Documentation 

IX.	Support and new features

#### [2.1] Client Brief 

This phase of development pertains to the act of retrieving a brief that details or defines the client’s requirements for the build asset. In correlation to Vulnerabilities, during this phase it is not conceivable for vulnerabilities to appear due to the lack of development of a physically or theoretical build.  However, misinterpretation of said client’s requirements along with a lacking description of prerequisites or implausible client goals, could lead to vulnerabilities appearing at a later stage of development.



#### [2.2] Requirement Gathering 

In my view, requirement gathering is the act of clarifying and ascertaining more detailed information based on the brief already been given by the client, concerning the reason for employment and said “goals and achievements” that the client expects from the company. This usually includes clients analysing market requirements and features in demand, to see whether there is a real need for the software that is being developed in the current market.

A comprehensive understanding of the customers’ needs and writing down features of the proposed software product are the keys to success in this phase. Ur Rehman (2001) agrees that this phase is fundamentally the foundation or base for a project and failure to uphold or properly document could lead to a monumental catastrophe, with the project either failing to come together or veering off the client’s direction and vision for the project, not withholding or meeting the standards that the client may expect.

#### [2.3] Writing Functional Specifications 

 Following said client gathering, a review should ensue to determine whether said pre-defined or set requirements given by the client are plausible, subsequently then determining as to how to achieve said specifications (Functional specifications are based upon the product requirements documentation put forward), drawing upon a functional specification document, showing the behaviour or functionality of a software product on an abstract level.
 
The prominence of the usage of writing functional specifications relate to the creation of a design document, manuals for end-users, functional and architecture documents, being a means to communicate among groups disconnected by their software development landscape. Although during the product development phase amendments to functional specifications may be necessary, keeping in view new marketing requirements. 

#### [2.4] Architecture and Design Documents 

The architecture document in effect is formed once all the requirements have been collected and arranged. The document defines different components of the product and how they interact with each other.
 Further defining the technologies used to build the product. Whilst the documents are filled out and moulded around the project, the (project) team also needs to consider the timelines of the project. This refers to the target date when the product is required to be on the market.
 
Thereafter defining architecture, software components and their interfaces, the next phase of development is the creation of a design document. Through the architecture level, a component is defined and stated to provide certain functionality. Whilst during the generation of the design document (stage), you have to define what is in the component.

Although the design document and architecture document could be viewed or merged into one fully fledged documentation to easier navigate and locate information based on the project and formulate all the information on a component in one space rather than separating said information, hence while although the architecture and design are seen as two separate levels, the design document is essentially just elaborating on the architecture level, adding a miniscule amount of information still pertaining to the component only rather than for instance describing more explaining said component.

#### [2.5] Implementation and coding 

The Implementation and coding phase is initiated when software developers take the design documents and development tools (editors, compilers, debuggers etc.) and start writing software (Halvorsen 2017). 

This is an erroneous process and usually the longest phase in the product life cycle. Each developer has to write their own code to a standard, whilst collaborating with other developers to ensure that different components can interoperate with each other.
Subsequently this problematic issue may-be generally bypassed through using or outlining coding standards beforehand, ensuring that the written procedures are followed or abided by, thus enabling the code to be similar structurally and aesthetically. Furthermore, elaborating the reason for coding standards, during the project or product life cycle multiple people may modify files, therefore if people are not following the pre-set rules, this may easily break the whole compilation and building process. For instance, duplicate definitions of the same variables may cause problems, while similarly, if included files are not written properly, you can easily cause the creation of loops.

 #### [2.6] Testing and quality assurance

Subsequently once the implementation and coding stage is completed, the next phase in software development is to test said code to see whether it is functional and works to an exceptional standard meeting and assuring the quality. This may be initiated through managing the product life cycle and verifying that the software meets the defined quality standards or customer agreements (quality assurance), thereafter with regards to the testing aspect may be instigated during the production phase, concerned with finding ways of breaking software, coding in segments or pushing out versions of said application software are integral to ensure a more accurate test. 
In addition, throughout testing the ideology behind it is to get a group of testers to observe what the software does and to report on the level of quality as well as any serious issues they encounter (under the assumption that the system is flawed and has copious amounts of bugs) (Qatestlab Blog 2005-2010).

#### [2.7] Software release 

Before the subsequent marketing and selling of a software product it needs to be officially released. This essentially pertaining to the creation of a state of the software in a repository (a copy), ensuring that it has been tested for functionality, etc. A version number is assigned to the released software. After releasing the software, development may continue but will not impact or make any subsequent changes to the released software. 

The development is usually carried on in a new branch and it may contain new features of the product. The released software is updated only if a bug fixed version is released. 

Usually incremental version numbers are assigned following a scheme of when the next release of the software is sent to market, whilst the change in version number depends on whether the new software contains a major change to the previous version or it contains bug fixes and enhancement to existing functionality. Releases are also important because they are typically compiled versions of a particular version of the code, and thus provide a stable set of binaries for testing, which could assist in mitigating vulnerabilities(In simpler terms the paragraphs above pertain to the updates and patches in software development after and before release).

#### [2.8] Documentation 

Reliable documentation in my opinion, is crucial throughout software development (life cycle). The presence of documentation should in principle help keep track of all aspects of an application and improve the quality of a software product. Furthermore, mainly focusing on development, maintenance and knowledge transfer to other developers (Trica 2017). Through the use of said documentation, information should be more easily accessible (information all gathered in one point or origin). 

Inaccurate documentation is a fundamental cause pertaining to Vulnerabilities. Since a document is the congregation of information usually linking to all stages of a project, failure to update, properly maintain or the inclusion of faulty data can lead to Vulnerabilities occurring. An instance of documentation leading to vulnerabilities may be seen in particularly during the testing phase as erroneous results could be noted as fixed despite the problem re-occurring and still existing.

#### [2.9] Support and New Features 

This usually heralds after the development of software, though is still integral to the cycle as users of said developed software may need support after release. In addition, new features may be a factor or prerequisite with updates coming out to compete with competitors’ products that may have other features.Moreover, better support usually leads to better branding and devotion among user’s, creating or leading to the generation of a referral business.

#### [2.10] Software Development Life Cycles 

SDLC or the abbreviated term System Development Life Cycle is a term generally applied to system engineering, information systems and software engineering to describe the process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system (Wikipedia 2018).

This interconnects with software development as the numerous life cycle’s methodology’s define the procedure’s and show regulated development, portraying the process of the plan, creation and deployment of an information system.

Further once applied to the development of software acts as a formatted structure, that once followed may bring about advantages or wrought disadvantages depending on the life cycle used, all singular life cycles are useful if applied in the correct situations and therefore it is necessary to analysis the project size, structure, requirements, etc.before a life cycle is chosen to be applied. 

Examples of software development life cycles consist of; water fall method a sequential non-iterative design model, used in software development processes, Prototyping Model, Evolutionary Mode, etc. Further examples may be extracted from Alan (2017), as there are numerous other cycles, not covered in this report. 

#### [3] Vulnerabilities Topic  

The topic of Software vulnerabilities pertains to the (weaknesses/flaws) faults that may be exploited within a given system, thereafter compromising the system itself. 

A systems flaws may be subjugated or subjective to various different types of vulnerabilities and thereafter it is crucial to know the diverse array of vulnerabilities, their prevention and detection in order to try to avoid their presence in the final software version of the system and then reduce the possibility of attacks and costly damages.

The knowledge of any given vulnerability in a system may give an attacker who is exploiting said vulnerability the ability to reduce a systems information assurance, also allowing access to sensitive files and data harmful to the cliental of an organisation (user’s) or the organisation itself (exploiting a loophole). 

Vulnerabilities are essentially the intersection of three elements: a system susceptibility or flaw, attacker access to the flaw, and attacker capability to exploit the flaw (Jimenez et al. no date).

#### [3.1] Examples of Vulnerabilities 

Following the above documentation, under the heading “Vulnerabilities Topic”, listed with the numerical digit 3, below details a few frequent vulnerabilities (Jimenez et al. no date):

•	Buffer overflow: this usually occurs during fixed length buffers when some data is going to be written beyond the boundaries of the current defined capacity (hence the use of the word “overflow”).  

This could lead to the system malfunctioning since the new data could in principle corrupt the data of other buffers or processes. 

In continuation Buffer overflow could also lead to loss of control and gain (for an attacker) over a system, through the injection of malicious code, subsequently altering the execution sequence of the program in order to execute the injected code, thus taking control of the system.

	XSS or cross site scripting: commonly associated or connected to web applications, cross site scripting consists of the injection of code in pages accessed by other users. Through exploitation an attacker may bypass access controls, perform phishing, identity theft or expose connections. 

	SQL injection: consists of injecting code with the intension of exploiting the content of a database. This usually happens because the inputs are not handled correctly, an attacker may retrieve or get sensitive information from the database (under attack).

#### [4] Case Studies 

#### [4.1] Case Study:” goto fail” 2014 Apple 

In 2014, Apple fixed a critical security vulnerability that was sought to be caused through the use of "cut and paste" during editing. The programmer embedded a duplicate line of code that caused the software to bypass a block of code that verifies the authenticity of access credentials (connections to secure sites could be spied on). The essence of the problem, though straight forward, led to invalid certificates being quietly accepted as valid (woody 2015).
The vulnerability is described in the National Vulnerability Database cited by Ducklin (2014) as follows:

-	"Impact: An attacker with a privileged network position may capture or modify data in sessions protected by SSL/TLS" –

-	"Description: Secure Transport failed to validate the authenticity of the connection. This issue was addressed by restoring missing validation steps." -

Researchers learnt of this security flaw in iPhones and iPads, with the confirmation of Apple stating that it was also present in notebook and desktop machines using the Mac OS X operating system. 

This vulnerability essentially led to attackers being able to use invalid credentials to gain access to any information on the targeted device such as email, financial data, and access credentials to other systems and devices.

Further elaborating on the root cause of the problem the second (duplicate) “goto fail, the indentation found within the code (segment displayed below) was misleading, since the code didn’t retain or use curly braces after the “if” statement, the second “goto fail” was therefore always executed. 

In context, this meant that vital signature checking code was skipped, so all signatures regardless of authenticity were registered as acceptable. The extraneous “goto” caused the function to return 0 (“no error”) when the rest of the checking was skipped, as a result causing invalid certificates to be accepted and thus lead to what is now termed or coined as the "goto fail" incident (Wheeler 2017).

 #### [4.2] Case Study: 2017 Equifax Breach 
 
In 2017 Equifax experienced a breach in their systems resulting in the loss of sensitive data and personal records on 145 million Americans and hundreds of thousands in the UK and Canada. The extent and impact of such a breach, along with the information procured by attackers could have led to identity theft (impersonation), as seen in similar cases earlier experienced in 2017, known as "IRS FAFSA tool breach" (Qatestlab Blog 2005-2010). 

Further delving into how the breach resulted and vulnerabilities was exploited, it occurred due to the negligence of Equifax, failing to find and promptly patch publicly known vulnerability in Apache Struts (a free, open-source, MVC framework for creating elegant, modern Java web applications.), which was used in its Consumer Dispute Portal.
In simple terms apache struts was essentially used to develop their own software or portal that held important user information, however during development and due to a fault in the software used for development (apache struts) a vulnerability materialized and went unnoticed.

Moreover, the vulnerability was exploited over 2 months after a fix was made available. In addition, the company did not discover that its systems had been compromised for another 1.5 months. This series of failures demonstrates the significant weaknesses in Equifax’s security program during this time frame (Sethi 2017) (BBC News 2017) (Thomson 2018).

#### [5] Mitigating Software Vulnerabilities 

Models are a first approach to deal with vulnerabilities and their understanding (putting in stronger controls and fleshing out the software better). However, it is necessary to count on methods or procedures to prevent any risks related to vulnerabilities.

Further ways of mitigation is software inspection, this usually consists of reading or visually inspecting the program code or documents in order to find any defects and correct them early in the development process, though this generally relies on the ability of the person viewing the code (Simmons 2015). 

Security testing is also another integral method of finding vulnerabilities in a system, if the vulnerabilities make it all the way to a test environment, security testing tools and manual techniques may discover these types of issues (Leemon 2015).

In regards to mitigating or preventing software vulnerabilities being exploited, that have occurred during the development of software but went unnoticed, consistent monitoring of applications for unusually activity may halt attacks, though not ideal in this phase, it is critical to have controls in the right place (National Cyber Security Centre 2016). 

#### [6] Conclusion 

In conclusion forming an opinion on the basis  of the information presented above, concerning the case studies, in the Apple situation and Equifax state of affairs, during both occurrences the vulnerabilities presented and exploited by the alleged attackers could have been prevented and mitigated if the necessary cautions and procedures were put in place and followed, with the apple incident stemming from human negligence that could have been prevented if a proper software inspection took place , similarities can be seen with regards to the Equifax situation, where if the code was manually reviewed, steps could have been put in motion to mitigate said vulnerabilities that appeared.

Through further analysis it may be seen that the response taken by Apple was optimal, though with regards to Equifax's response not all information regarding the attack was exposed and neither were there consistent monitorisation by their operation team as the exploitation of said vulnerability had occurred 1.5 months before the organisation had found out about the attack , showing that the operation team was not searching for unusual activity which could have led to the situation devolving before reaching the stage it did. Whilst it also took another 2 months to fix and roll out a patch.
In my opinion, which is supported by research (Anton et al 2003) whilst the situation for both high profile organisations were eventually sorted with the vulnerabilities found in the condescending software being mitigated.  The foremost factor being whether these's vulnerabilities could have been mitigated earlier (during development), rather than only after release. Which based on factual evidence and methodologies used in the prevention of vulnerabilities, points to the decisive answer being certainly.

### Secondary Research Vulnerabilities; formulation, Comparison and analysis; Conclusion 


#### Introduction

This report details information on an investigation and gathering of primary research to see whether the information would support an ongoing study relating to whether; 

 Are the conglomerate of ICT students and non ICT students aware of the issues of vulnerabilities?

	Are ICT students or non ICT students aware of possible ways to mitigate vulnerabilities?

	Do the two groups of conglomerates (ICT students and non ICT students) know why vulnerabilities may occur in a system?

Furthermore a comparative analysis of both primary and secondary information is covered on the basis that a conclusive answer is formed. Whilst detail as to how the study was brought forth and carried out is also mentioned in the following document. 

The deductions documented or detailed below are based on data that has been reviewed, modified, deleted and replaced using a technique known as data cleansing. Data cleansing refers to the proccess of replacing, modifying, or deleting coarse data, emphasising the mitigation of inconsistencies  ensuring a consistent data set. The data gathered was then congregated (assembled) into information, therefore solidifying the points brought across in the below document.

Moreover  it appears that  part of  the primary data is proving to be inconclusive due to errors in the consultations (answers provided), though this may be used to further prove and answer theoretical questions brought across, whilst also present`s the opportunity to evaluate and suggest room for further improvements when designing and producing a survey in the future.

#### Primary Research Plan

The ground work for the primary research was essentially covered through the application of a pre-formulated survey basing questions around information covered and pertained in the secondary research carried out prior. 

In continuation to the prior point, sampling methods were also applied in the application of said survey, using the methodology such as the simple random sampling (SRS) method; a subset of a statistical population in which each member of the subset has an equal probability of being chosen. 

The principle reason behind the use of said technique was to essentially cover and acquire a wide range of results and findings, thereafter varying the results through all ages. Though what was a common occurrence or what each surveyee had in common was that they were related in some form to the ICT department or were of a young age, this only veering or deviating in 5 occurrences out of the 20 surveyed, in which four were unrelated to the IT industry, whilst another relayed inconclusive findings as all the information noted by said surveyee can be seen to be falsified and the erroneous data was omitted from the graph charts, during data cleaning. There was also another occurrence in which the name noted down seemed fabricated (Cartoon Character’s Name; Johnny Bravo) , though since the name is not the most integral part of the survey and all the other fields and factors were covered, seemly with intuitive answers it is still possible to relay viable information from the data.

Further delving into the factors and reason behind the high number of ICT students that took the survey, this can be seen to stem from the fact that all the ICT department is based on the same floor therefore it is no surprise that the majority of the data gathered is from said students and is in fact beneficial to the questions imposed above.

Following said practical use of Simple random sampling another method used during the design and presentation of the survey was a non-probability method known as haphazard sample, heralding similarities to the simple random research method, but ultimately SRS is a probability method. This was used to meet time scales as Haphazard sampling essentially entails choosing people based on their relative ease of access, though this was not necessary disadvantageous as it furthered the group/age range as to who was covered , making it more plausible and enabling for an output of a more broader view when answering the pre-listed queries in this documentation.  

#### Analysis 

Through thorough analysis of the information (portrayed in a graph) retrieved and formed based on the congregation of data, it may be seen that the majority of those surveyed understand what a Vulnerability is, however when enquired if they understood the issues of vulnerabilities there was  a mixed  response, with seven out of the twenty stating that they do not understand the issues (Issues, meaning what would happen if left unchecked) of vulnerabilities, though one of the surveyees answers were deemed invalid based on in accurate findings retrieved, whilst another was unsure as to the intention  of the question and thus left it blank. This only furthers the idea that due to the incapability of answering that it is likely that the surveyee did not understand the issues.

Further delving into the numbers the data shows that despite being below half of those surveyed there was still a large margin with whom did not know the problems vulnerabilities may herald which is daunting taking into consideration 15 out of the 20 either work in an ICT related field or are learning ICT as a subject, so it is probable that said students or tutors have covered said subject. Whilst three of the non ICT students displayed a slight understanding,more than the ICT students. However this information cannot be comparitive, since the number of ICT students trumps the number of non- ICT students. This  means that it is more likely an outcome occurs where the amount of non ICT students in a ratio of knowing and not knowing, have a higher rate of having an understanding in comparision to the amount (numerical value) not understanding. 

In continuation to the points covered above based on the statistics and facts it may be gathered that those surveyed understand why vulnerabilities may occur, working in correlation with the data gathered that 18 out of the twenty when posed with numerous options as to the definition of vulnerabilities chose the correct choice that is; faults that may be exploited in a given system. Whereas when enquired about the reasons as to why faults or vulnerabilities may occur  particularly in windows and apples systems the main trend or a common factor could be seen to be Human error, whether this relates to client or the business side. 

Whilst other common occurrences seemed to be lack of monitoring and manual reading of code, all common flaws that organisations are usually exploited by as seen and covered in the secondary research report and case studies gotofail (Apple Breach) and Equifax (Breach). Where vulnerabilities were seemly caused by Human error; in the case of the gotofail vulnerability it was stated to have occurred due to negligence not reviewing the code thus leading to a duplication of a line being left in with a missing parenthesis. Equifax’s vulnerabilities seemed to have occurred due to software faults used for or during development and lack of monitoring , though the impact or outcome could have been mitigated or reduced based on whether the proper monitoring and procedures were put in place. Thus supporting the idea and fronting that the majority of people know the reasons behind vulnerabilities in software or systems (the comparative analysis between data and real life situations substantiate this).


#### Conclusion

In conclusion ascertaining prospective proposals, through the analysis of all the data congregated during both the second and primary research. In paticular using the case studies it may be seen that the most probable course of action with regards to ensuring no security breaches occur with vulnerabilities not arising, would be to facilitate through testing during and after development. This would essentially lessen the amount of exploits within the system since all factors have been considered, tested and fixed either before the software has been ushered out or after through updates. 

Further taking into consideration the feedback gathered from surveyees, (primary research) in addition to the case studies and software development stages covered in the secondary research, monitoring along with the  inclusion of versions is suggested to be premeditated and if possible implemented. The reason for self regulation or monitoring is to ensure that any unusual activity is catalogued, thus preventing the issue from getting out of hand as a patch may be avaliable with those responsible or involved being delegated punishments.  Whilst the addition of versions essentially allows the for user feedback,branching upon the idea of updates, which would ensure that the software is compatable with the latest system, with the user feedback proving viable when implementing theses updates as the feedback recieved may point to bugs previously missed, thus ensuring the software quality upon release and removing exploits.   

The concluding recommendation's would be to use a model to alleviate or lesson the likelyhood of vulnerabilities. This would essentially  put in stronger controls and flesh out the software better.Along with Model checking a technique which tests if the model of a system meets its specification and it can be used to detect vulnerabilities.


### Self-Reflection

The value of undertaking this research to meet stated objectives and own learning performance is great, this is primary due to the self- reflection that occurs after the research has already been carried out, thus presenting the opportunity to evaluate what went well, what went wrong, what could have been done to attain a more favourable outcome and essentially improve or learn from the mistakes made during this research project. In relation to meeting stated objectives the research enables important querys to be answered with meaningful conclusions drawn and applied in other projects.

In self reflectance in regards to any future research carried out inconjunction to any probable projects, it would be best to better articulate the questions, considering the use of versions getting people to fill out forms during a data run, then asking questions as to whether they thought the questions were adequate. This would then enable alteracations to take place if necessary. This is integral due to the predicament encountered during this research project where certain questions were misconstrued or the lengthiness of the questions left those surveyed unwilling to anwser.

In continuation with the point that the questions were too protracted, the use of tick boxes along with pre-set answers would have covered this as those surveyed would probaly feel more abliged and bothered to give a more accurate answer.
